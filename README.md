**Background**

The purpose of this analysis is to use open source Airbnb data to determine what factors impact the price an Airbnb can be listed at. The dataset is limited to just Airbnb's in the New York City area. Our analysis is aimed to support someone looking into purchasing a property with the intent to rent it on Airbnb. Our analysis will show what factors influence price and other important metrics such as availibilty or customer satisfaction.

**Conclusion**

We have analyzed various factors that affect the price of Airbnbs across New York. The major ones being Location and Number of rooms. The bigger the room, the higher the price. The best location to open an Airbnb now would be Manhattan as it is the business and tourism hub that would attract a far greater crowd than any other place. The second best option would be to open an Airbnb in Brooklyn and even give out private rooms instead of full houses as both are highly revenue generating.
